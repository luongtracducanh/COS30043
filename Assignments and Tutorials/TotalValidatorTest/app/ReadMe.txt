                    TOTAL VALIDATOR TEST
------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION

Total Validator allows you to perform many different
tests on web pages in one go, rather than using
several tools to achieve the same thing. It can simultaneously
test Accessibility, HTML, CSS, run a spell check, and test for
broken links. This test version will tell you if you have any
issues but you must buy the Basic or Pro versions to see where
the issues are in order to fix them.

To access all the features of Total Validator, such as Document
Object Model (DOM) testing for javascripted sites, you should
install our browser extensions as well.

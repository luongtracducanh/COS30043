<h2 id="content"><a id="intro"></a><a href="help.html" title="Documentation Contents">Documentation</a> &gt; Login forms</h2>
<p>Many websites restrict parts of their site, and Total Validator
needs to be authenticated to test these pages. The original way
of doing this is was to use HTTP Authentication, and the
<a href="network.html">Network</a> options are available to facilitate this.
</p>
<p>A more modern approach is to use a 'login form', where the user enters an id and password
or other identifying information into the form, and the server sets a session cookie to 
say that user has been authenticated, and can then visit the restricted pages.
</p>
<p>Total Validator supports two ways of authenticating using login forms. The easiest is to login
through your browser and use one of our <a href="https://www.totalvalidator.com/products/extension.html" aria-label="Details of Browser extensions">
browser extensions</a> to start testing.
Alternatively, you can enter the login details directly into the <a href="#pro">Pro</a> version.
In both cases you must skip any <a href="#logoff">log off and delete links</a> and set any
<a href="#options">other form related options</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="extensions">Using a browser extension</h2>
<p>This is by far the easiest way to work with login forms, and should work with almost every type there is.
</p>
<p>In your browser, log into the site. Your browser should now hold a session
cookie allowing access to the restricted pages. 
Then use one of our <a href="https://www.totalvalidator.com/products/extension.html" aria-label="Details of Browser extensions">
browser extensions</a> to start testing.
</p>
<p>The browser extension will pass the session cookie to
Total Validator so that it can test the restricted pages of the website. But you still need ensure that you
configure it to skip any <a href="#logoff">log off and delete links</a>, and set any
<a href="#options">other form related options</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="pro">Using just the Pro version</h2>
<p>If you are using Total Validator Pro without a browser extension then the <a href="forms.html">Forms</a> options can be used
to log into the website. When a form is found that matches
the <a href="forms.html#action">Action URL</a>, Total Validator will effectively click the
appropriate <a href="forms.html#submit">Submit button</a> sending any hidden or default
form parameters together with any <a href="forms.html#parameters">parameters</a> that you've
explicitly specified (typically your id and password).
</p>
<p>If successful, the web server will normally return the first secure page and set a session
cookie in Total Validator. It can then follow all the links on this page, testing the
restricted pages in the usual way.
</p>
<p>Note that you must skip any <a href="#logoff">log off and delete links</a> and set any
<a href="#options">other form related options</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="logoff">Log off and delete links</h2>
<p>It is very common to add a link to every restricted page, which logs you off
when followed. Because Total Validator may test and follow these links,
it will be logged off. Any restricted pages that are then tested will
either show as failed links or just be the page containing the login form. The number of pages
tested will then be very short and this problem easy to spot. Sometimes you will also
see errors complaining about links that redirect to themselves.
</p>
<p>There may also be links on pages that delete or otherwise destroy resources.
A common example is to display a list of documents in a table with a column of links to
delete each document, or even a 'delete all' link. In this case Total Validator will
faithfully follow each link deleting all the documents. Note that it is good programming
practice to replace all such links with submit buttons instead, although this may not
always be possible.
</p>
<p>You can solve these issues by telling Total Validator to skip these log off and delete links using the
<a href="include.html#excludepaths">Exclude</a> option.</p>

<h2 id="options">Related options</h2>
<p>Most login forms use cookies to store details about the login session, so you must ensure that Total Validator is set to <a href="network.html#cookies">accept cookies</a> (the default setting <code class="tv">Server</code> will do this).
</p>
<p>With single sign-on systems such as SAML, you log in on one site and end up at another. Total Validator Pro has been tested with several SAML based systems including Shibboleth and Athens. But there are many caveats, so please see our dedicated <a href="saml.html">SAML topic</a> for more information on how to configure for SAML.
</p>
<p>Finally, remember that Total Validator does not execute any JavaScript, so the login form must not rely on javascript for activation.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example forms</h2>
<p>We have provided an <a href="https://www.totalvalidator.com/help/examples.html">example form</a> which illustrates how you would normally configure Total Validator to work with a login form. We advise anyone attempting to use login forms to first practice with this form to avoid many common problems.
